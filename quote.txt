The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same. 
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.
If you live to be 100, I hope I live to be 100 minus 1 day, so I never have to live without you.
I like to listen.
